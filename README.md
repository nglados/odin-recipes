At this moment, I'm practicing about HTML and GIT, just to get in touch with the language and tools. Making this "README" file with Visual Studio Code and learning the basics with the command line. 

The objective of this project it's to gain knowledge and improve everything that I learned before to create a basic website with some links to a few recipes.

Thanks Odin.
